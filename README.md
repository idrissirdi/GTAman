You love GTA or yet do you love pac-man  it doesnt matter since we got both
I bet you are asking how you play my amazing game
well all you need to do is download the zip file provided 
once you download it extract it
Press the windows icon and lookup CMD/command prompt
once you do that use the cd command to go to the directory where you downloaded the file example(cd Downloads\GTAman)
to run it type "java App.java"
Now play GTAman by escaping the cops and collecting cocaine
Also right after you die play this video: https://youtu.be/VkoUfE6DzKw
Greatest JAVA game of all time
This project couldnt have been done without my partner chatgpt he helped with the main bulk of the java code while I would tweak it here and there I also did all the art.
I am very proud of what we were able to acomplish over these 55 years of creating this game so I hope you enjoy.
I would have loved to finish and implement more stuff though, even though I had 55 years to make this game, I spent all my time doing graphics and failed on overall agmeplay content.
